I am a data scientist/developer who was formally trained as a earth scientist. I have called Zürich, Switzerland home since 2011. I previously worked [felfel ag](https://felfel.ch) as a data scientist and developer, helping them improve their product sales forecasting, demand management, and generally helping them to use data to make better business decisions. Prior to working as a data scientist, I studied and researched earth sciences with a focus on geochemistry and environmental data.

I earned a Ph.D. in Environmental Systems Science from the ETH Zürich in Zürich, Switzerland. My research focused on understanding the atmospheric deposition of the nutrient trace element [Selenium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium) :waxing_crescent_moon: (not to be confused with the web testing framework [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/)). As part of this work, I analyzed large environmental, climate back-trajectory, and remote-sensing (i.e. satellite images) datasets, and necessitated that I teach myself how to program. This naturally led me to my current career in data science, where I've spent the last 3+ years continually learning how to become a better data scientist, developer and machine learning practitioner.

Outside of my professional life, I have a lot of hobbies that I really enjoy. I very much need to be outdoors with some frequency and particularly enjoy being in the mountains, ski touring in the winter and rock climbing in the non-snowy seasons. I like to run and in the past few years have taken to trail running. I am an avid cook and home baker (mostly bread). My father taught me to brew beer :beer: when I was 19 and I have been doing it since that time. I've recently taken over part of a share in a community garden plot in Zürich so the past year I have been slowly learning more about gardening and permaculture. The list of hobbies grows ever longer :grin:.

I've built this page as a way to keep up to date a bit on some of the frontend and [React.js](https://reactjs.com) development I've taught myself over the past few years, and as a way to track some of the things I'm currently learning about. I'll probably also be posting some random things relating to my hobbies as well. And I'll probably put some of the photos I take on here. :camera: Photography is another hobby of mine.

## About this site

I built this site in React.js using a scaffold supplied by the fantastic [react-boilerplate](https://reactboilerplate.com/) project. This project uses a number of great technologies: [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management, [react-router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) for routing, [Redux sagas](https://redux-saga.js.org/) for async, a bunch more. This project is very actively managed and while it takes a while to grasp all the separate technologies that it employs, it's a really great way to build web apps. I've also used [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) for managing most of the content on the site. Contentful provides a great easy platform for hosting content and they have a really simple API which allows for easy access of all sorts of different types of data. Lastly, the site is being continuously deployed using [Netlify](https://netlify.com), which allows you to easily link a github repository and then it handles all the deployment of the site. So every time I push changes to the code of this site it gets automatically deployed. So cool! :ski:
